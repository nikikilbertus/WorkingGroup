## Welcome to the Helmholtz-TUM-UHH Working Group "Causal Machine Learning"

The goal of the working group is to promote research on Causal Machine Learning and to foster Causal Machine Learning for applications in both science and industry in Germany and Europe.

The group organises joint seminars on topics in Causal Machine Learning with renowned guest speakers, an annual retreat to discuss research ideas, and conferences on this topic. 


### Members

The working group consists of the following groups:

[Prof. Dr. Niki Kilbertus](https://sites.google.com/view/nikikilbertus)

[Prof. Dr. Helmut Farbmacher](https://www.professoren.tum.de/en/farbmacher-helmut)

### Seminars

Seminar presentations and invited talks from academia and industry will be announced here.

### Conferences

The group organises the bi-annual conference series "Econometrics in the Castle". The series started in [2018](https://www.mpisoc.mpg.de/veranstaltungen/detail/event/econometrics-in-the-castle-machine-learning-in-economics-and-econometrics/) with Victor Chernozhukov (MIT) and Stefan Wager (Stanford) as keynote speakers, but was interrupted because of Covid. To be continued.

Moreover, conferences for the exchange with industry are planned.

### Retreat

The group has an annual retreat to discuss ongoing research and early research ideas.

### Open positions

Open positions can be found on the website of the members.
